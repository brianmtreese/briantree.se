	<h1 class="pageTitle">About Brian Treese</h1>
	<p class="intro">
		<span class="dropcap">M</span>y name is Brian Treese. I am married to Jennifer Treese, and I am the father of two children: my son Avery and my daughter Dakota. Professionally, I am the Chief of User Experience at <a href="https://socreate.it">SoCreate</a>, where I work with a team of talented professionals.

	<p>
		I have been designing and building websites since the early 2000s, which is over 20 years of experience in web development.
	</p>
	<p>
		I built my first website in college for a t-shirt company that I started with two friends. The website included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a> animations and blinking text. The t-shirt company did not succeed as a business, but both of my former business partners went on to create successful companies: one founded <a href="https://www.1850restaurant.com/">1850 Restaurant and Brewery</a> and the other founded <a href="https://www.thefungitemple.com/">Fungi Temple</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		After the t-shirt business ended, I created my first professional portfolio website without Flash animations or blinking text. I used this portfolio to apply for a position at Couto Solutions, where I was hired by Justin Couto.
	</p>
	<p>
		When I started at Couto Solutions, my design skills were stronger than my coding skills. For the first paid website project I worked on at Couto Solutions, my coworker Jami, who was a software developer, taught me how to use the Slice tool in Adobe Photoshop. At that time, I had limited knowledge of HTML and CSS. Through daily use over the past 20+ years, I have developed expertise in HTML, CSS, and many other front-end programming languages, frameworks, tools, and technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Working in web development requires continuous learning because technologies and best practices change frequently. I work hard to stay current with industry changes and new technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, I work as the Chief of User Experience at SoCreate, where I collaborate daily with skilled developers to build products using modern web technologies. I enjoy the challenges of this work, and I also enjoy teaching others what I have learned. I have created tutorials, courses, and resources to help other web developers improve their skills.
