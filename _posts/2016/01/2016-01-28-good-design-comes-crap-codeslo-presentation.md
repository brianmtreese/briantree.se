<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> was lucky enough to get the invite from Matt West, founder/organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/codeslo/" target="_blank">CodeSLO</a>, via my coworker <a href="https://twitter.com/schwarty" target="_blank">@schwarty</a> to give a presentation at the CodeSLO meetup <a href="http://www.meetup.com/codeslo/events/226806744/" target="_blank">"HTML and CSS - Part 3 - Modern Web Design"</a> meet up. This was a good time. I got to get out and talk shop with a great group of people who were excited to learn about design and the role it plays on the web. My talk went a little over thirty minutes and covered the basic principles of good design: contrast, repetition, proximity, alignment, layout, typography, color, and more. For those that were unable to attend, feel free to take a look at the slides to see what you missed...</p>
