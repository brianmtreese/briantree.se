Layout on the web is undergoing a major transformation. Things like Flexbox, CSS Grid, and now CSS Shapes are really helping to modernize layout on the web and browser vendors are listening by adding support for these features.

In my newest [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course, [Thinking Outside the Box with CSS Shapes](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/css-shapes-thinking-outside-box?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=authordemo), we cover how web designers/developers can use CSS shapes to create rich, complex layouts like those common in print design. This course will introduce you to the CSS Shapes specification and show you how to use its properties in-depth. You'll learn about various interesting use cases and examples, ranging from basic to complex, as well as the future of the spec, browser support, and helpful tools and resources. By the end of this course, you'll be up and running with CSS shapes, and thinking about web design and layout in a whole new way.
