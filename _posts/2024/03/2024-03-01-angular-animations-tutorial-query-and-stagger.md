<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span> work in Angular every day and I build things that need to be animated or transitioned when interacted with. And, because of this, I’m thankful for the Animations module. There are so many useful features available that make life much easier. We’re going to look at two of these features in this post. First, we’re going to use the <code><a href="https://angular.io/api/animations/query">query()</a></code> function to find and animate several items at once. Then, we’ll use the <code><a href="https://angular.io/api/animations/stagger">stagger()</a></code> function to create a delay between the animations running on each of these items. Alright, let’s get to it!</p>

Before we get too far along, it’s important to note here that I’ve already created several posts focused on the animation framework. They cover the basics of setting up and using Angular animations, creating state-based and `:enter`/`:leave` animations, and using the `keyframes()` function to create more complex animation sequences. So, if any of those concepts are unfamiliar to you, you’ll probably want to check those posts out first so that you’re not lost in this post.

Ok, enough of that, onto the example for this post.

## The Demo Application

Here we have this application listing out some NBA players. At first, we only see Lebron James, but when we click the add button at the bottom, the list is updated to show the rest of the players from our collection. And, when we hit the remove button, all players but Lebron are removed.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2024/03-01/demo-add-remove-players-no-animation.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of a demo application adding and removing list items without animations" width="678" height="942" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

This is cool but the way these items are added and removed is a little lame. It would be better to transition them in and out like this wouldn’t it?

</div>

Well, this is actually all possible with the Angular Animations module.

## Using the `query()` Function to Animate Multiple Items as They Enter and Leave

We’re going to start by using the `query()` function to query for all items entering and leaving the DOM to transition them as they do so. The `query()` function expects a selector parameter as a string, then an array of `AnimationMetadata`, and optionally an options object of `AnimationQueryOptions`.

```typescript
query(selector: string,
      animation: AnimationMetadata | AnimationMetadata[],
      options: AnimationQueryOptions)
```

Ok, let’s look at some code. For our list of players, we start with an array of the first player in the list data, Lebron.

#### main.ts
```typescript
protected players = [players[0]];
```

Then, when we hit the add button, we call this `addplayers()` function which will add a bunch more players to the array, from our players data.

```typescript
protected addPlayers() {
    const allPlayers = players.slice(1);
    this.players = [...this.players, ...allPlayers];
}
```

And when we hit the remove button we call this `removePlayers()` function to remove all but the first player from the list.

```typescript
protected removePlayers() {
    this.players = [this.players[0]];
}
```

Then, in the template, we use a `@for` loop to iterate over the array of player objects to loop out a player component, for each player which, displays the data.

#### app.component.html
```html
<section cdkScrollable>
    <div>
        @for (player of players; track player.name) {
            <app-player [player]="player"></app-player>
        } @empty {
            <p>Sorry, we couldn't find any players with the name you entered</p>
        }
    </div>
</section>
```

Now, if we recall from [the post I created on `:enter` and `:leave` animations]({% post_url /2024/02/2024-02-23-angular-animations-tutorial-the-keyframes-function %}), these items are being added to and removed from the DOM so we can transition these using the [`:enter`](https://angular.io/api/animations/query#entering-and-leaving-elements) and  [`:leave`](https://angular.io/api/animations/query#entering-and-leaving-elements) aliases.

### Setting up the Animation

We start by adding our `animations` array within our component. Then we add an animation trigger with the [`trigger()`](https://angular.io/api/animations/trigger) method, let’s name it “animation”. Within the array for this trigger, we’ll add a transition using the [`transition()`](https://angular.io/api/animations/transition) method.

We’re going to bind this animation to our `players` array, so when that array data changes, we trigger our animation. This means that for our state, we will need to animate from any state to any state, which we can do with, an asterisk, arrows both ways, and then another asterisk.

#### main.ts
```typescript
import { transition, trigger } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    animations: [
        trigger('animation', [
            transition('* <=> *', [
            ]
        ])
    ]
})
```

Alright, so all of that animation configuration, up to this point, should be familiar from my previous posts on animations. But now we’re going to do something you may not have seen before. We’re going to use the `query()` function.

### Using the `query()` Function for the Enter Animation

This function will query within the element the trigger is placed on, for items matching the selector or selectors provided to it. In our case we are going to add it to the element that contains our `@for` loop. The reason for this is so that we can query for all items being added to the DOM, nested within this container, using the `:enter` alias.

```typescript
import { ..., query } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    animations: [
        trigger('animation', [
            transition('* <=> *', [
                query(':enter')
            ]
        ])
    ]
})
```

Ok, after providing the selector, we need to provide our animations as an array. First, let’s add the style that we’ll start from with the [`style()`](https://angular.io/api/animations/style) function. Let’s start from an opacity of zero, and transform from a scale of point seven. So, the items will start out scaled down and invisible.

```typescript
import { ..., style } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    animations: [
        trigger('animation', [
            transition('* <=> *', [
                query(':enter', [
                    style({opacity: 0, transform: 'scale(0.7)'})
                ])
            ]
        ])
    ]
})
```

Then we’ll create our transition using the [`animate()`](https://angular.io/api/animations/animate) method. We’ll animate over five hundred milliseconds, and we’ll use an ease-in timing function. Now let’s add the style we’ll transition to with another `style()` function. We’ll end at an opacity of one so that it’s fully visible, and we’ll transform to a scale of one so that it’s full size.

```typescript
import { ..., animate } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    animations: [
        trigger('animation', [
            transition('* <=> *', [
                query(':enter', [
                    style({opacity: 0, transform: 'scale(0.7)'}),
                    animate('500ms ease-in', style({opacity: 1, transform: 'scale(1)'}))
                ])
            ]
        ])
    ]
})
```

Ok, now let’s go into the template, and bind the animation trigger onto our div, and we’ll use the `players` field to trigger the animation.

#### app.component.html
```html
<section cdkScrollable>
    <div [@animation]="players">
        @for (player of players; track player.name) {
            ...
        }
    </div>
</section>
```

Ok, let’s save and see how this looks.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2024/03-01/items-partially-animating-on-enter.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Using the query() function to ad a basic :enter animation" width="880" height="992" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

When we hit the add button now, we can see all the items transition in nicely. That’s cool, so we know this animation is properly querying for all items entering and properly transitioning them.

### Using the `query()` Function for the Leave Animation

Ok, now let’s get them animating out on `:leave`. Let’s just copy our enter animation, and then switch query for items leaving with the `:leave` alias. Then we just need to flip the styles that we’re animating between. So, we’ll start with an opacity of one, and a scale of one. Then, we’ll animate to an opacity of zero, and a scale of point seven.

#### main.ts
```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    animations: [
        trigger('animation', [
            transition('* <=> *', [
                ...,
                query(':leave', [
                    style({opacity: 1, transform: 'scale(1)'}),
                    animate('500ms ease-in', style({opacity: 0, transform: 'scale(0.7)'}))
                ])
            ]
        ])
    ]
})
```

Ok, let’s save and try this now.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2024/03-01/items-broken-animations.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Broken animations using the query() function" width="880" height="990" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Woah, it looks like the `:enter` animation is no longer working. And the `:leave` animation is doing some weird stuff too. But, there’s a reason for this.

### Making the Animation `query()` Optional

When using the `query()` function, sometimes there may be no items matching the items you’re querying for. And this is the case for our `:leave` animation. On initialization, there’s only one thing happening, one item is entering because we have only one list item. There are no items leaving, so we get an error which we can se if we expand the console.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2024/03-01/query-returned-zero-elements-error.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Error using the query() function when zero elements are found" width="910" height="288" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

It tells us exactly what’s happening and what we need to do to fix it. We just need to add this options object, with optional set to true, to our queries.

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    animations: [
        trigger('animation', [
            transition('* <=> *', [
                query(':enter', [
                    ...
                ], { optional: true }),
                query(':leave', [
                    ...
                ], { optional: true })
            ]
        ])
    ]
})
```

Ok, now let’s save and try again.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2024/03-01/items-partially-animating-on-enter-and-leave.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Error using the query() function when zero elements are found" width="878" height="992" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Nice, now our `:enter` animation is working correctly again. And, this time, our `:leave` animation is working too. But I really don’t like how all of these items animate in at the same time. I would rather stagger them in and out, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do next.

## Adding a Stagger Effect When Many Items are Aminating at Once

For this stagger effect, Angular has us covered with the [`stagger()`](https://angular.io/api/animations/stagger) function. This function expects the animation timings as a string or number, exactly like we’re used with the `animate()` function. And for its second parameter, it expects an array of `AnimationMetadata`, also like we’re used to with the `animate()` function.

```typescript
stagger(timings: string | number,
        animation: AnimationMetadata | AnimationMetadata[])
```

Ok, so let’s add the stagger function to our enter animation.

### Staggering Items as They Enter

Here, we’re going to wrap the `animation()` function, so we’ll add the `stagger()` function. And the first parameter is the timing to delay the animation, we’ll go with one hundred milliseconds. Then, we have an array, and this will wrap the animation.

```typescript
import { ..., stagger } from '@angular/animations';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    animations: [
        trigger('animation', [
            transition('* <=> *', [
                query(':enter', [
                    style({opacity: 0, transform: 'scale(0.7)'}),
                    stagger(100, [
                        animate('500ms ease-in', style({opacity: 1, transform: 'scale(1)'}))
                    ])
                ], { optional: true }),
                ...
            ]
        ])
    ]
})
```

Ok, let’s save and see how it works now.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2024/03-01/items-staggered-as-they-enter.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Staggering items as the enter they DOM using the query() and stagger() functions" width="880" height="990" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Cool, that’s a much nicer effect. I like that a lot better. Ok, now let’s stagger them as they leave too.

### Staggering Items as They Leave

We just need to add the `stagger()` function around our `:leave` animation this time. And, we’ll keep the one hundred millisecond timing to be consistent.

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    animations: [
        trigger('animation', [
            transition('* <=> *', [
                ...,
                query(':leave', [
                    style({opacity: 1, transform: 'scale(1)'}),
                    stagger(100, [
                        animate('500ms ease-in', style({opacity: 0, transform: 'scale(0.7)'}))
                    ])
                ], { optional: true })
            ]
        ])
    ]
})
```

Ok, let’s save and try this now.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2024/03-01/items-staggered-as-they-enter-and-leave.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Staggering items as they enter and leave the DOM using the query() and stagger() functions" width="882" height="990" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Ok, that’s cool. It’s staggering now but I’d rather it stagger them out the other way so that the last item to leave is the one at the top instead it being the first item to leave like it is now.

### Reversing the Stagger Order

Well, guess what, this is pretty easy to do. We just need to make the timing a negative number.

```typescript
stagger(-100, [
    ...
])
```

Now, let’s save and try one more time.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2024/03-01/items-with-stagger-reversed-as-they-leave.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Staggered items with order reversed as they leave the DOM using the query() and stagger() with a negative duration" width="878" height="992" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Nice, now that seems like the right way to animate those.

### Conclusion

Ok so now you know how to query for one-to-many items to animate, and you know how to stagger them too. So, hopefully you found this helpful.

Now remember, there’s still a lot to the animation framework, so I’ll go ahead and stop here for now, but I will be creating several more posts on Angular animations very soon.
