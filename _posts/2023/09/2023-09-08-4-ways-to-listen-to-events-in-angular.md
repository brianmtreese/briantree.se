<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">S</span>ometimes we need to react to certain events in the browser and write code against them. Maybe we need to listen to a click, input change, focus, or blur. Maybe we need to do something like listen for a click anywhere within the document. Well, good news, we’ve got many ways to do this in Angular. In this post I’m going to show you four common ways.</p>

- First, we’ll use a method called event binding.
- Next, we’ll use the `@HostListener` decorator.
- After that, we'll use an Angular `@Output` and `EventEmitter`.
- And finally, we’ll use the `Renderer2` class and its `listen()` method.

Alright, let’s get into it!

## Using Angular Event Binding

In Angular, event binding is used in the simple of cases and we probably want to use it almost as a default scenario anytime we need to listen for events on an element. Only if event binding doesn't work for us should we reach for something else.

<div class="shirt-ad">
<a href="https://devdrip.creator-spring.com" title="Click to get yourself some fresh Angular merch!">
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/dev-drip-banner.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Swoop up some hip new Angular drip! - Dev Drip Merch Shop" width="960" height="275" style="width: 100%; height: auto;"></a>
</div>

Event binding in Angular is pretty simple to set up, we'll just use parentheses and whatever event we need. In this case, we're going to bind to the focus event. And, when we focus in our text box, we just want to push a string value, “input focus”, into our messages array in this component.

### example.component.ts
```html
<input
    ...
    (focus)="messages.push('input focus')" />
```

Now when we focus, we see that an event fires. Then, when we focus again the event continues to fire.

<div>

</div>

We can add other events too so how about a blur event?

```html
<input
    ...
    (blur)="messages.push('input blur')" />
```

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2023/09-08/input-blur-event.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of input blur event binding in Angular" width="784" height="514" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

We can even do things like listen for an input event on our textbox. So, if we add a value, every time we type a keystroke, we'll see an event fire for “input change”.

```html
<input
    ...
    (input)="messages.push('input input')" />
```

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2023/09-08/input-input-event.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of input input event binding in Angular" width="786" height="520" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Now what if we need to bind to an event on the host of a directive or a component? Well, in angular we have the `@HostListener` decorator that we can use to do this exact sort of thing.

## Using the @HostListener Decorator on a Directive

Alright in this example, in order to demonstrate how `@HostListener` works, I went ahead and added this `appHostListener` directive on our button.

```html
<button appHostListener>
    Submit
</button>
```

What we're going to do is within this directive we're going to listen for click events on the actual button itself. But we want to do this every time we put this directive on so in this case, we're going to use our `@HostListener` event.

So, let's go into the directive and add our `@HostListener` decorator. We need to make sure and import this from Angular Core. Then we'll bind this click event right within our decorator and pass along our event with a `$event`. We'll name our function handleHostClick() and we'll have our event within this which will be of type `PointerEvent`.

### host-listener.directive.ts
```typescript
import { ..., HostListener } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({selector: '[appHostListener]'})
export class HostListenerDirective {
    @HostListener('click', ['$event']) handleHostClick(event: PointerEvent) {
    }
}
```

Now, within this listener, to prevent the form from submitting when we click this button, let's add `preventDefault()`, and then add an alert for when the button is clicked.

```typescript
@HostListener('click', ['$event']) handleHostClick(event: PointerEvent) {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert('Button Clicked!');
}
```

Okay so let's see what happens.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2023/09-08/host-listener-click-alert.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example a @HostListener event alert in Angular" width="634" height="354" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And there we go, an alert fires with our "Button Clicked!" message.

So, what if we actually wanted to react to the fact that our button was clicked
and do the same thing that we're doing when the input events fire? So, when our button gets clicked we want to add to our messages array. 

Well, we have a way that we can do this from our directive. We can build our own custom event using an Angular `@Output` and an `EventEmitter`.

### Using a Custom Event With an `@Output` and `EventEmitter` 

Okay so we'll add our `@Output` and `EventEmitter` within our host listener directive. To do this let's start by adding an @Output. This comes from Angular Core as well, so we need to make sure it's imported. We'll name this output "buttonClick" and set it equal to a `new EventEmitter` that will emit a `PointerEvent`. `EventEmitter` also needs to be imported from Angular Core.

```typescript
import { ..., Output, EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({selector: '[appHostListener]'})
export class HostListenerDirective {
    @Output() buttonClick = new EventEmitter<PointerEvent>();
}
```

Now in our HostListener function, instead of alerting that the button was clicked we're going to emit the `buttonClick` event.

```typescript
@HostListener('click', ['$event']) handleHostClick(event: PointerEvent) {
    ...
    this.buttonClick.emit();
}
```

Now we need to go wire up this `buttonClick` event. Back over to our example component template on our button we'll wire up a custom event and we'll push a new “button click” message into our list when this happens.

### example.component.ts
```html
<button appHostListener (buttonClick)="messages.push('button click')">
    Submit
</button>
```

Okay now let's see what happens when we click our button.

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2023/09-08/host-listener-click-event-emitter.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example a @HostListener EventEmitter in Angular" width="784" height="400" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And there we go, our custom event now fires and properly adds a message into the list.

## Using the Renderer2 listen() Method
Okay so now this time we want to listen to click events on our document as a whole and react to those. So how can we do this? Well, we can use the Renderer2 class because it has the ability to take in any element and listen to any event on fired on that element. So, let's look at how we would do this.

Since we only want to listen for these global clicks in this example component when it lives on the page, we're going to do it right from within this component which makes the `Renderer2` a perfect candidate for what we're trying to do.

To start, we need to import the `Renderer2` and provide it in the `constructor`. We'll also need our `ngOnInit()` method and our `ngOnDestroy()` method as well.

### example.component.ts
```typescript
import { Component, OnDestroy, OnInit, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  templateUrl: './example.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./example.component.css'],
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
    constructor(private renderer: Renderer2) {}
}
```

Now what we're going to do is add a variable for our `bodyClickListener` and we'll type this as a void function.

```typescript
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
    private bodyClickListener?: () => void;
    ...
}
```

Now we'll set this using the `Renderer2` and the `listen()` function. The first parameter that this listen function takes is the element that we want to listen on, so in this case, it'll be `document.body`. The next parameter is the event that we want to listen for, in this case, it's going to be the `click` event. And then we have the callback that we want to fire every time this event fires. For this we want to push a “body click” message into our messages array.

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
    this.bodyClickListener = this.renderer.listen(
        document.body,
        'click',
        (event) => {
            this.messages.push('body click');
        }
    );
}
```

Okay so how'd we do?

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2023/09-08/renderer-2-body-click.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example using the Render2 listen method in Angular" width="782" height="452" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

There we go, clicking anywhere on the body fires an event.

Now when doing this we also need to make sure that when this component is destroyed that we properly clean up the event listener to avoid performance issues and memory leaks. We do this within the `ngOnDestroy` method and if our `bodyClickListener` is defined we simply need to call the void function.

```typescript
ngOnDestroy() {
    if (this.bodyClickListener) {
        this.bodyClickListener();
    }
}
```

There now this will be properly cleaned up when the component is destroyed and prevent any memory leaks.

So we now have 4 different ways to listen to events in Angular. First, we have class binding for more standard cases where we simply need to react to an event on an element. Then, we have the `@HostListener` decorator which allows us to listen to events on the `host` element of our components and directives. Then, we can add our own custom events with an `@Output` and an `EventEmitter`. And finally, we can use the `Renderer2` `listen()` method if nothing else works.

So hopefully these examples give you a few extra options for building in Angular.
