<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">N</span>avigation can be a hard thing to master. Handling it intuitively and in a usable fashion is even more challenging with the wide variety of devices and screen resolutions available. Most sites tend to just shove all of their menu items under some three bar icon and expand the menu when clicked. Seems to work pretty well, but what If your were to think of navigation in a whole new way?</p>

That's exactly what [Mary Lou](http://tympanus.net/codrops/author/crnacura/) from [codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) has done with her [Perspective Page View Navigation example](http://tympanus.net/Development/PerspectivePageViewNavigation/). She does some pretty nifty stuff with transitions and transforms allowing the page to morph within three dimensional space in order to expose the menu items. She provides multiple different effects and variations to keep you from getting bored. This pleasing effect could be a very delightful experience for your site's visitors.
