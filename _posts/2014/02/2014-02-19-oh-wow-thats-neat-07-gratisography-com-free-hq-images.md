<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ooking for high quality pictures to use in your personal or commercial projects? Don't want to pay tons of cash for overused stock photos? Well, you're in luck thanks to [Ryan McGuire](http://www.laughandpee.com/) from [Bells Design](http://www.bellsdesign.com/).</p>

He has captured and continues to capture amazing, high quality photos and he is providing them for us to use free of copyright restrictions with his site [Gratisography.com](http://gratisography.com).

This is a great resource and has been very useful for me. In fact, you may see some of his images in a few of my posts.
