<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e pick up lots of pieces of knowledge over time when working with CSS and then if we don't use them often we can forget how to use them and then have to spend time either looking it up again or looking for where we used them in other projects.</p>

Well, [Adam Schwartz](http://adamschwartz.co/), a Principal Software Engineer at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com/) has created a nice little resource documenting the stuff that he's learned about CSS called [The Magic of CSS](http://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css/).

## [The Magic of CSS](http://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css/)

In his book he has captured some really great details, hints, tips and put it together in a really nice and easy to process manner. The topics covered range from basic to advanced but require an understanding of how CSS works.
