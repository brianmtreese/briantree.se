<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen you create a new Illustrator document the grid will always be aligned based off the upper left corner of the art board. Personally, I always want it to be aligned to the top center. How do you do that? Well, the simplest way that I've found is to actually just center the art board.</p>

<style>
.demoBox {text-align:center}
.demoBox img {margin-bottom: 0 !important} 
</style>

## Here's How it Works

After you have created your new document click on the "Artboard Tool" icon in the toolbar or hit (Shift + O)

<div class="demoBox">
<img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/artboard-tool.png">
</div>

## Adjust the Reference Point

Make sure the reference point is set to the top center

<div class="demoBox">
<img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/reference-point.png">
</div>

## Set the X Value

Set the X value to zero and that's it

<div class="demoBox">
<img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/x-value.png">
</div>
