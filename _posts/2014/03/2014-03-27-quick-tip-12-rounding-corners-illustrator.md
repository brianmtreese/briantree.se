<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ver needed to quickly and precisely round corners on vector shapes and typography already added to your designs in illustrator? Well, it's pretty easy to do nowadays.</p>

<style>
.demoBox { text-align: center; }
</style>

## Here’s How it Works

Select the objects you want to have rounded corners on and then go to "Effects" in the top tools bar, then "Effects" under "Illustrator Effects", then click the "Rounded Corners" option

<div class="demoBox">

## Set the Radius

You will then be presented with a dialog asking for a radius, in this case I used 20px

<div class="demoBox">
<img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/rounded-corners.png" alt="You will then be presented with a dialog asking for a radius, in this case I used 20px" width="640" height="639"></div>

## Need to Edit the Radius?

If you ever need to edit this radius later on you can do so by using the Appearance Panel

<div class="demoBox">
<img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/rounded-corners-edit-1024x842.png" alt="If you ever need to edit this radius later on you can do so by using the Appearance Panel" width="640" height="526"></div>
