<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou can now place PhotoShop documents within other PhotoShop documents. This is awesome when you are in the process of mocking up large scale applications consisting of common components like site headers, footers, navigation, etc. It also helps to keep these design elements consistent when developing with a team of designers.</p>

<style>
.demoBox { text-align: center; }
.demoBox img { margin-bottom: 0 !important }
</style>

## Here's How it Works

Navigate to the file menu and select "Place..."

<div class="demoBox"><img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/file-menu.png" width="404" height="800" alt="Navigate to the file menu and select Place..."></div>

## Select a Document

Next select the document you would like to place

<div class="demoBox"><img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/place.png" width="640" height="582" alt="Next select the document you would like to place"></div>

That's it! It's that simple. Then, when you make modifications to the placed document it's really easy to update it in all of the documents that contain it.

## Modify the Placed Document

Open the placed document, make your modifications and then save it. Next, right click on the placed document within the layers panel and then choose "Replace Contents..."

<div class="demoBox"><img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/replace-contents.png" alt="Open the placed document, make your modifications and then save it. Next, right click on the placed document within the layers panel and then choose Replace Contents..." width="640" height="942"></div>

## Update the Placed Document

Next, choose the updated file and it will replace the current one.

<div class="demoBox"><img src="../../assets/img/content/uploads/2014/place.png" width="640" height="582" alt="Next, choose the updated file and it will replace the current one."></div>

That's it, super cool and very useful.
