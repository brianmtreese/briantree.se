<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ver built a "read more" component that just brutally chops off content mid-sentence? We've all been there. Today, I'll show you how to quickly build out a smooth expandable content component in Angular that actually looks professional. We'll start with a basic toggle that does absolutely nothing visual and transform it into something with elegant height transitions and a subtle fade effect. Okay, let's turn this sad excuse for a component into something you'd actually want to show off!</p>

## The Broken Component

We're starting with a super basic Angular application with some content that needs to toggle:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/07-24/demo-1.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="The broken component with the button that does nothing except toggle the text" width="936" height="1076" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Currently, when we click the button, all that happens is the text changes between "more" and "less".

That's literally all it does right now.

So, let's fix this and make it actually do something meaningful.

### Why Not Use HTML Details?

Before we dive in, you might be wondering: 

> "Hey, doesn't HTML have a details element for this?"

Good question! 

While [details/summary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/details){:target="_blank"} is great for simple show/hide functionality, we want something more flexible.

We want to toggle arbitrary content, starting at any height, with smooth animations, and a subtle fade effect. 

Think of this as the `details` element's cooler, more customizable cousin.

## Understanding the Foundation

Okay, let's start by understanding what we're working with. 

Let's take a look at the [toggle height component template](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qhpgpryy?file=src%2Ftoggle-height%2Ftoggle-height.component.html){:target="_blank"}.

Here we have an `article` element that contains a generic content slot:

```html
<article>
    <ng-content></ng-content>
</article>
```

This will put whatever content the parent component gives us right here.

Below that, we have our footer with the button that calls the "toggle()" method when clicked:

```html
<footer>
    <button (click)="toggle()">
        ...
    </button>
</footer>
```

Then we have either a "Less" or "More" label based on whether the component is expanded which is tracked with an "isExpanded()" [signal](https://angular.dev/guide/signals){:target="_blank"}:

```html
@if (isExpanded()) {
    Less
} @else {
    More
}
```

## The Signal-Powered Logic

Now let's switch to the [component TypeScript file](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qhpgpryy?file=src%2Ftoggle-height%2Ftoggle-height.component.ts){:target="_blank"} to see what's happening under the hood.

Here's our "isExpanded()" signal:

```typescript
export class ToggleHeightComponent {
    protected isExpanded = signal(false);
    ...
}
```

It's initialized to false, so we start collapsed.

And then, we're binding a class on the [component host](https://angular.dev/guide/components/host-elements){:target="_blank"} when this "isExpanded()" signal is true:

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-toggle-height',
    ...,
    host: {
        '[class.expanded]': 'isExpanded()'
    }
})
```

We'll need to use this class in a minute as part of the toggle functionality.

Finally, we have the "toggle()" method that's used to toggle the value of the "isExpanded()" signal:

```typescript
export class ToggleHeightComponent {
    ...
    protected toggle() {
        this.isExpanded.update(v => !v);
    }
}
```

This is a great starting point, but here's the problem: we're not actually doing anything with this expanded state except changing the button text. 

Time to fix that.

## Adding Real Functionality

Let's make this component actually expandable.

First, I'm going to add a new [input](https://angular.dev/guide/components/inputs){:target="_blank"} called "collapsedHeight" and I'll provide a default value of 50px:

```typescript
import { ..., input } from "@angular/core";

export class ToggleHeightComponent {
    collapsedHeight = input('50px');
    ...
}
```

This makes our component configurable. 

Different instances can have different collapsed heights depending on their needs.

And if we don't provide a custom height, it will default to 50px. 

Now we can use [style binding](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/binding#css-style-properties){:target="_blank"} to add a [custom property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties){:target="_blank"} on the host using this input value:

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-toggle-height',
    ...,
    host: {
        ...,
        '[style.--collapsedHeight]': 'collapsedHeight()',
    }
})
```

CSS custom properties are like variables in CSS, but the cool part is we can even set them dynamically from JavaScript.

We'll use this in our component styles in a minute as part of the overall expand/collapse strategy.

Okay, to make this work properly, we need to be able to measure the actual height of our content. 

And to do that, we need a reference to the DOM element.

Let's switch back to the HTML template and add a template reference variable to our article element

```html
<article #container>
    ...
</article>
```

This gives us a way to access this specific DOM element from our TypeScript.

Now let's switch back to the component TypeScript to wire this all up.

Let's add a new property called "container" where we'll use the [viewChild](https://angular.dev/api/core/viewChild){:target="_blank"} function to access the element.

This item will be required, it will be typed as an [ElementRef](https://angular.dev/api/core/ElementRef), and we can use our "container" reference label as the selector:

```typescript
import { ..., viewChild } from "@angular/core";

export class ToggleHeightComponent {
    protected container = viewChild.required<ElementRef>('container');
    ...
}
```

In this case, viewChild is Angular's way of saying: 

>"Give me direct access to that DOM element." 

Think of it like getting a backstage pass. 

Instead of just seeing the element from the audience, we can go behind the scenes and actually measure it, manipulate it, whatever we need.

Next, we need a signal to track our expanded height.

It'll either be a string or null and we'll initialize it to null:

```typescript
export class ToggleHeightComponent {
    protected expandedHeight = signal<string | null>(null);
    ...
}
```

Next, we can bind another custom property for this value on the host so that we can access it from the component styles as well:

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-toggle-height',
    ...,
    host: {
        ...,
        '[style.--expandedHeight]': 'expandedHeight()',
    }
})
```

Now we need to update the toggle method to actually calculate the expanded height.

We'll use the "set()" method to set this value, but we're going to set it based on whether the component is expanded or not.

If we are expanded, we'll set the value to the [scrollHeight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollHeight){:target="_blank"} of the article, if not it'll be null:

```typescript
export class ToggleHeightComponent {
    ...
    protected toggle() {
        this.isExpanded.update(v => !v);
        this.expandedHeight.set(
            this.isExpanded() ?
                `${this.container().nativeElement.scrollHeight}px` : null);
    }
}
```

Using the scrollHeight gives us the total height of the content, including any content that's currently hidden due to overflow.

It's perfect for this use case because it tells us exactly how tall our element needs to be to show all its content.

Also, using null when the container is collapsed will remove the custom property from the host entirely.

### CSS Magic: Making It Work

Now, let's take a look at the [component SCSS](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qhpgpryy?file=src%2Ftoggle-height%2Ftoggle-height.component.scss){:target="_blank"}.

Currently, the article just has `overflow: hidden` which prevents content from spilling out. 

But now we need to actually control the height.

Let's set the height using our `--collapsedHeight` custom property:

```scss
article {
    overflow: hidden;
    height: var(--collapsedHeight);
}
```

Now we need to add styles for when we're expanded.

For this, let's use the [:host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host){:target="_blank"} selector with the "expanded" class to target the article element in the expanded state:

```scss
:host(.expanded) article {
}
```

Now, whatever styles we add here will apply to our article element, but only when the host has the "expanded" class.

So now, let's set the height using the `--expandedHeight` custom property:

```scss
:host(.expanded) article {
    height: var(--expandedHeight);
}
```

### Testing Our Basic Version

Okay, I think that should be all we need so let's save and see how it works.

Moment of truth…

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/07-24/demo-2.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="The toggle height component set up to now properly toggle but without transitions and without the fade effect" width="774" height="1058" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Boom! Look at that expanding and collapsing!

And then, if we want this to start out taller in this particular case, we can switch over to [the root component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qhpgpryy?file=src%2Fmain.ts){:target="_blank"} where it's included and add a custom value using our input.

Let's go with 120px:

```html
<app-toggle-height collapsedHeight="120px">
    ...
</app-toggle-height>
```

Okay let's save this again and see how it looks:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/07-24/demo-3.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="The toggle height component configured to start out taller using the collapsedHeight input" width="776" height="1062" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Perfect! Now we can see more content initially, and when we click 'More', it still expands to show the full text.

Alright, phase one complete. 

We have basic expanding and collapsing. 

Now for phase two: making it actually look good.

Here comes the fun part, we're about to turn this basic toggle into something that would make even the most picky designer happy.

## The Professional Polish

Right now, the content just gets cut off abruptly, which looks a bit harsh:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/07-24/demo-4.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The toggle height component with the content cut off abruptly" width="1036" height="520" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Let's add a nice fade effect to make it more elegant.

I'm going to add a [mask-image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-image){:target="_blank"} using a [linear-gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient){:target="_blank"} to create a fade-out effect at the bottom of the collapsed content:

```scss
article {
    ...,
    mask-image: linear-gradient(
        black, 
        black calc(100% - 1.5em), 
        rgba(black, 0) 100%);
}
```

We're going from fully opaque black to transparent, which means the content will gradually fade out over the last 1.5em of height.

Then we need to add a [mask-size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-size){:target="_blank"} for this to make sure it fits the content properly:

```scss
article {
    ...,
    mask-size: 100% calc(100% + 1.5em);
}
```

And finally, we need to use the [mask-position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mask-position){:target="_blank"} property to position this mask at the bottom of the container:

```scss
article {
    ...,
    mask-position: bottom;
}
```

By the way, if you want to dive deeper into CSS masks, I have [another tutorial](https://youtu.be/xz9jkLceRGQ){:target="_blank"} that can really help.

Masks are incredibly powerful once you understand them!

Now if we were to leave this as is, when we expand the content, we'd be showing everything, but the fade effect will still be there.

That means the last bit of content will still fade out, even in the expanded state.

Let's fix this by adding some extra padding in this case:

```scss
:host(.expanded) article {
    ...,
    padding-block-end: 1.5em;
}
```

And while we're here, let's make this transition smooth instead of jarring.

Let's animate both the height change and the padding change over a quarter second with an ease timing function:

```scss
article {
    ...,
    transition: 
        height 0.25s ease, 
        padding-block-end 0.25s ease;
}
```

This should make it all feel much more polished.

Okay, let's save and check out the final result:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/07-24/demo-5.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="The final toggle height component with the fade effect and smooth transitions" width="1000" height="1072" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Perfect! Look at this beautiful, smooth transition. 

The content fades out elegantly when collapsed, and when I expand it, everything slides down smoothly with no jarring cuts. 

And when I collapse it again, that fade effect makes it look like the content is gracefully disappearing rather than being brutally chopped off.

## Make It Your Own

And there you have it! We transformed a useless toggle into a polished, reusable component using Angular's modern features and a little CSS magic.

Try adding different fade effects or transitions... the possibilities are endless!
