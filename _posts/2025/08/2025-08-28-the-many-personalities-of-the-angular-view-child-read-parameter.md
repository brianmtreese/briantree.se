<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">M</span>ost Angular developers know about <a href="https://angular.dev/api/core/viewChild" target="_blank">viewChild()</a>, but many don’t know about its secret weapon, the read parameter. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how you can use it to unlock completely different scenarios inside your components. By the end, you’ll not only understand what it does, you’ll be using it to write cleaner, more powerful Angular code.</p>

## Project Setup: Demo App Overview

Here’s the app we’ll be working with in this tutorial:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The demo app before any changes" width="1314" height="332" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

It’s a simple Angular component that’s going to be used to demonstrate the read parameter in the `viewChild()` signal query.  

Now if you’ve never heard of the read parameter, don’t worry, many Angular developers haven’t and that’s exactly why I’m making this tutorial!  

Right now, this thing is pretty boring. 

It's just a box with some text and a button that doesn’t do anything yet.  

But by the end of this tutorial, this single element is going to demonstrate four completely different ways we can access it from our component code.  

Let's start by examining the template for this component.

The first thing we find is a `div` with a [template reference variable](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/variables#template-reference-variables){:target="_blank"} named `#reference`:

```html
<div 
    #reference 
    class="demo-box" 
    appHighlight 
    [highlightColor]="'lightblue'">
    <p>This element demonstrates all "read" parameter types</p>
</div>
```

This is the box that we saw in the screenshot of the app in the browser.

This `div` also has an `appHighlight` directive applied to it as well.

Then, below that `div`, we have an `ng-template` and it also has the same reference variable too:

```html
<ng-template #reference>
    <div class="template-content">Template content added!</div>
</ng-template>
```

Inside of this template, there's a `div` with a simple message.

[ng-template](https://angular.dev/api/core/ng-template){:target="_blank"} is Angular's way of defining a chunk of HTML that doesn't render by default, it's like having a blueprint that we can use later.

Normally, using the same reference twice would be confusing. 

Here, it’s intentional to show how and why the read parameter is useful.

And finally, below all of that, we have a `button` that calls a `run()` function when clicked:

```html
<footer>
    <button (click)="run()">Run Demo</button>
</footer>
```

Okay, that's the template, now let's take a look at the TypeScript for this component.

Right now it's pretty empty, it just has a `run()` function that does nothing:

```typescript
import { ChangeDetectionStrategy, Component } from "@angular/core";
import { HighlightDirective } from "../highlight";

@Component({
    selector: 'app-demo',
    templateUrl: './demo.html',
    styleUrl: './demo.scss',
    changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
    imports: [HighlightDirective],
})
export class DemoComponent {
    protected run() {
    }
}
```

## viewChild() Explained: Default Behavior

What we want to do now is access the element from our template, so how do we do that?

Well, with the `viewChild()` signal query of course!

```typescript
private readonly elementRef = viewChild('reference');
```

By default, Angular just returns *something* with the matching reference, often whichever comes first in the template.  

- If the `div` comes first → we get an [ElementRef](https://angular.dev/api/core/ElementRef){:target="_blank"}  
- If the `ng-template` comes first → we get a [TemplateRef](https://angular.dev/api/core/TemplateRef){:target="_blank"}  

This default behavior is unreliable when multiple elements share the same reference name.  

That’s where the read parameter comes in.

## ElementRef: Taking Control with the Read Parameter

Now, I'm going to modify the `viewChild()` to be explicit about what we want.

Let’s add an options parameter with the `read` property set to `ElementRef`:

```typescript
private readonly elementRef = viewChild('reference', { read: ElementRef });
```

By adding this, we explicitly tell Angular: 
> “Give me the `ElementRef` for this reference, no guessing required.”  

This makes the code more predictable and maintainable.

Now, let's actually do something with this `ElementRef`.

Let's add a CSS class to change the appearance of our div.

To safely manipulate the DOM in Angular, I need to [inject](https://angular.dev/api/core/inject){:target="_blank"} the [Renderer2](https://angular.dev/api/core/Renderer2){:target="_blank"} service:

```typescript
private renderer = inject(Renderer2);
```

This works in all environments, including [server-side rendering](https://angular.dev/guide/ssr){:target="_blank"}, unlike direct DOM manipulation.

Now we can use the Renderer2 to add a CSS class called “highlighted” to our element, and we'll also log out the element to the console:

```typescript
protected run() {
    const element = this.elementRef();
    if (element) {
        this.renderer.addClass(element.nativeElement, 'highlighted');
        console.log('ElementRef:', element);
    }
}
```

Now when we click the "Run demo" button, the box turns yellow:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The demo app after adding the highlighted class" width="1312" height="424" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

That's our “highlighted” CSS class in action.

And in the console, we're getting an `ElementRef` just like we’d expect:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The console output after clicking the button showing the ElementRef" width="1232" height="168" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

This just shows how the read parameter ensures consistency even if the template changes.

It's important to note here that order still matters, even with the read parameter.

If I move the `ng-template` before the div, we'll actually get an error in the console now:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-4.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The console error after moving the ng-template before the div" width="1238" height="224" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

This is because now we’re trying to add a class to the comment element inserted from the `ng-template` which we can’t do.

So just keep this in mind when using `viewChild()` with the same reference name.

## ViewContainerRef: Dynamic Content Injection

Now here's where things start to get interesting.

The same element can unlock new capabilities depending on what you ask for with read.

Let’s add another `viewChild()` for the same reference, but this time using [ViewContainerRef](https://angular.dev/api/core/ViewContainerRef){:target="_blank"}:

```typescript
private readonly containerRef = viewChild('reference', { read: ViewContainerRef });
```

Now, you may be asking yourself...  
> “What's a `ViewContainerRef`?” 

Think of it as a content injection point.

It's like having a container where you can dynamically add components, templates, or other content at runtime. 

It’s a powerful tool for dynamic UIs.

Now let’s add a condition for this and then add a console log if it exists.

Also, we’ll do more with this in a minute, but for now let’s use the `Renderer2` again to add a class to this `div` using the `ViewContainerRef` this time:

```typescript
protected run() {
    ...

    const container = this.containerRef();
    if (container) {
        this.renderer.addClass(container.element.nativeElement, 'has-content');
        console.log('ViewContainerRef:', container);
    }
}
```

This will show that we can access the same element through different reference types.

When we click the button now, we get a dotted border around the `div` because this new class is being applied:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-5.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The demo app after adding the has-content class" width="1312" height="502" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And in the console, we now have both an `ElementRef` and a `ViewContainerRef` logged out, both pointing to the same DOM element but giving us different capabilities:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-6.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The console output after clicking the button showing the ElementRef and ViewContainerRef" width="1210" height="488" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Pretty cool, right?

Now let’s do more with this `ViewContainerRef`.

## TemplateRef: Accessing and Injecting Templates

As we saw above, we have an `ng-template` with the same reference name. 

Well, we can use this `ViewContainerRef` to dynamically inject that template content into our `div`.

First, we need to use the reference variable again to ask Angular for a `TemplateRef` using the read parameter:

```typescript
private readonly templateRef = viewChild('reference', { read: TemplateRef });
```

Even though the `div` and `ng-template` share the same #reference variable, Angular now gives us the template because that’s what we requested.  

With `TemplateRef` plus `ViewContainerRef`, we can now:  

- Create an embedded view from the template  
- Dynamically inject that content into the `div`

Here's what that looks like:

```typescript
protected run() {
    ...

    const template = this.templateRef();
    if (template && container) {
        container.createEmbeddedView(template);
        console.log('TemplateRef:', template);
    }
}
```

Suddenly, static markup becomes flexible and dynamic.

Now when we click the button, we get the template content added to our `div`:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-7.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The demo app after adding dynamic template content" width="1312" height="438" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And in the console, we now have all three reference types logged: 

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-8.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The console output after clicking the button showing the ElementRef, ViewContainerRef, and TemplateRef" width="1230" height="468" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

1. `ElementRef` → for DOM manipulation
2. `ViewContainerRef` → for content injection
3. `TemplateRef` → for the template itself

## Directive Access: The Final Superpower

But wait, there's more! 

Remember the `appHighlight` directive applied to our `div`?  

We can get direct access to that directive instance too with the `read` parameter:

```typescript
private readonly directiveRef = viewChild('reference', { read: HighlightDirective });
```

Okay, now let's log this out in the `run()` method just like the others:

```typescript
protected run() {
    ...

    const directive = this.directiveRef();
    if (directive) {
        console.log('Directive:', directive);
    }
}
```

Now when we click the button, we get the directive instance logged out too:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/08-28/demo-9.png' | relative_url }}" alt="The console output after clicking the button showing the ElementRef, ViewContainerRef, TemplateRef, and Directive" width="1218" height="422" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

This means we can:  

- Call methods on the directive  
- Change its properties  
- Interact with it programmatically  

One template reference, multiple possibilities.

## Recap & Key Takeaways

So there you have it, the `viewChild()` read parameter. 

This is one of those Angular features that's incredibly powerful but criminally underused.

Here's what you need to remember, the read parameter lets you get exactly what you need from any template reference: 

- `ElementRef` → Direct DOM access
- `ViewContainerRef` → Dynamic content  
- `TemplateRef` → Template access 
- `Directives` → Programmatic access to directive instances  

One reference, several superpowers. 

Same element, completely different capabilities.
