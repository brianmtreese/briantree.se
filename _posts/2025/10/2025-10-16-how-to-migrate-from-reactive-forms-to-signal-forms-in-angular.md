## Demo Preview: Signup Form Behavior

First, let’s take a look at the app that we’ll be working on.

It’s a very basic signup form:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-1.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="A very basic signup form built with Reactive Forms in Angular" width="796" height="820" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

When we click into the name field and then blur it, we see an error message letting us know that this field is required:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-2.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the name field blurred showing the required error message" width="994" height="420" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Then when we focus and blur the email field, same thing:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-3.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the email field blurred showing the required error message" width="998" height="388" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Also, while this form is invalid, the submit button appears disabled:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-4.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the submit button disabled because the form is invalid" width="994" height="420" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Once we add a valid name, the error message goes away.

For the email, once we enter a value, the error message changes if we have a value that's not a valid email address:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the email field entered with a value that's not a valid email address showing the invalid email error message" width="998" height="388" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Once we have the correct email format, that error goes away and the button becomes enabled:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with all fields filled out and the form is valid so the submit button is enabled" width="998" height="388" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Currently, this is all done using Reactive Forms which are great, but the bummer is that they don’t use [signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals){:target="_blank"}, right?

And this is why we want to switch over to signal-based forms.

First, though, let’s look at the code to get a better understanding of how everything works currently.

## Reactive Forms Setup: TypeScript and Template

In [the component’s TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-jr5dxwk2?file=src%2Fform%2Fform.component.ts){:target="_blank"}, we can see the `form` property that is composed with a [FormGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroup){:target="_blank"}, the classic Reactive Forms API:

```typescript
protected form = new FormGroup<SignUpForm>({
    ...
});
```

Inside it, we have a `name` [FormControl](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormControl){:target="_blank"} that expects a string and is required:

```typescript
name: new FormControl<string>('', { 
    nonNullable: true, 
    validators: Validators.required
})
```

Then we have the `emailAddress` `FormControl` that also expects a string, is also required, and includes an email validator to make sure it’s a valid format:

```typescript
emailAddress: new FormControl<string>('', {
    nonNullable: true, 
    validators: [
        Validators.required,
        Validators.email
    ]
})
```

That’s why we got two different error messages depending on the state.

In [the template](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-jr5dxwk2?file=src%2Fform%2Fform.component.html){:target="_blank"}, we have a class that’s added based on the form’s validity and "touched" state:

```html
<article [class.invalid]="form.invalid && form.touched">
    ...
</article>
```

That’s how we get the red border when validation kicks in.

We’re using the [formGroup](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormGroupDirective){:target="_blank"} directive to bind our form on a wrapper div:

```html
<div [formGroup]="form">
    ...
</div>
```

This wires the template to the Angular FormGroup.

The `name` field uses the [formControlName](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormControlName){:target="_blank"} directive:

```html
<input type="text" formControlName="name" />
```

Below that, we have the validation message that shows when the name control is invalid and "touched":

```html
<div 
    [class.visible]="name.invalid && name.touched"
    class="error">
    Your name is required!
</div>
```

Then we have the same setup for the email field. 

We have the input bound to the `emailAddress` control:

```html
<input type="email" formControlName="emailAddress" autocomplete="none" />
```

Then its validation shows when the control is invalid and "touched" as well, but the message is a little different:

```html
<div 
    [class.visible]="emailAddress.invalid && emailAddress.touched"
    class="error">
    @if (emailAddress.hasError('required')) {
        Your email is required!
    } @else {
        Please enter a valid email address!
    }
</div>
```

In this case we need to show either the "required" message or the "improper format" message.

Below all of this, the button gets a "disabled" class whenever the form isn’t valid:

```html
<button [class.disabled]="form.invalid">Continue</button>
```

So that’s our "before", now let’s switch this to signal-based forms!

## Heads-Up: Signal Forms Are Experimental (Angular v21+)

Before we change anything, it’s important to note that **Signal Forms are currently experimental!**

The API may still change because the Angular team is iterating quickly, but this gives us an early look and a chance to provide feedback.

> Use with caution in production!

You’ll also need Angular v21 or a compatible next build to access these features.

## Migration Step-by-Step: Reactive → Signal Forms

Back in the TypeScript, we’ll migrate the form model to signals and validation to the new schema style.

First, we’ll update the interface for the form object switching from `FormControl` types to plain strings:

#### Before:
```typescript
interface SignUpForm {
    name: FormControl<string>;
    emailAddress: FormControl<string>;
}
```

#### After:
```typescript
interface SignUpForm {
    name: string;
    emailAddress: string;
}
```

This makes the data a simple, serializable object, perfect for signals.

Then, we’ll remove the entire form group and its controls. We won’t need them anymore.

We can also remove the `ReactiveFormsModule` from the component imports and delete the old form imports.

Now, we’re ready to bring in the new Signal Forms features.

### Signal Forms vs Reactive Forms: Key Differences

In classic Reactive Forms, your mental model is a tree of classes (form groups and form controls), and you subscribe to observables to react to updates.

With Signal Forms, the mental model shifts to:
- A plain data object wrapped in a signal (your single source of truth for form values)
- A form wrapper that gives you field-level signals for state (invalid, touched, errors) and value
- Template bindings that read these signals directly: no observables, no `formControlName`, and no `formGroup` wrapper

### TypeScript: Model Signal, form(), and Validators

First, in the template, we’ll be using a new `Control` directive, so let’s add it to the component imports array:

```typescript
import { Control } from '@angular/forms/signals';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-form',
    ...,
    imports: [ Control ]
})
```

Next, let's create a signal for the form’s data model, a single source of truth holding the form values as a plain object:

```typescript
protected readonly model = signal<SignUpForm>({ 
    name: '', 
    emailAddress: '' 
});
```

The form layer will keep this in sync with the actual inputs automatically. 

No manual subscriptions or setters.

Then, we’ll create a property for our form using the new `form()` function from the Signal Forms module.

```typescript
import { ..., form } from '@angular/forms/signals';

protected readonly form = form(this.model, schema => {});
```

It wraps our model signal and provides form-level reactivity.

Next, we’ll define a custom validation schema using the new validation functions.

We’ll make the `name` field required with a custom error message using the new `required()` function:

```typescript
import { ..., required } from '@angular/forms/signals';

protected readonly form = form(this.model, schema => {
    required(schema.name, { 
        message: 'Your name is required!'
    });
});
```

We'll need to do the same for `emailAddress`:

```typescript
protected readonly form = form(this.model, schema => {
    ...
    required(schema.emailAddress, { 
        message: 'Your email is required!'
    });
});
```

Then, in the case of the `emailAddress` control, we need to add an additional email format validator, right?

Well, we can use the new `email()` validator function for this:

```typescript
protected readonly form = form(this.model, schema => {
    ...
    email(schema.emailAddress, { 
        message: 'Please enter a valid email address!' 
    });
});
```

Each rule defines both the condition and the message that appears when it fails.

With that, our form logic is fully converted to signals.

## Template: [control] Directive and Error Messages

Now let’s update the template.

So now, the form property is a signal so we need to add parentheses to this property in the class binding.

Both `invalid` and `touched` are signals now too:

```html
<article [class.invalid]="form().invalid() && form().touched()">
    ...
</article>
```

With signal-based forms, we no longer have the need for the `formGroup` directive so we can just remove that.

#### Before: 

```html
<div [formGroup]="form">
    ...
</div>
```

#### After:
```html
<div>
    ...
</div>
```

Next, we used to need to access the `controls` object to access the specific control from a form:

```html
@let name = form.controls.name;
@let emailAddress = form.controls.emailAddress;
```

But not anymore, so both of these variables can be shortened:

```html
@let name = form.name;
@let emailAddress = form.emailAddress;
```

For the name field, we’ll replace `formControlName` with the new `[control]` directive:

```html
<input type="text" [control]="name" />
```

The error message classes now rely on signals, and we’ll use the `errors` array with its `message` property to show the proper validation text:

```html
<div 
    [class.visible]="name().invalid() && name().touched()"
    class="error">
    {% raw %}{{ name().errors()[0]?.message }}{% endraw %}
</div>
```

We’ll do the same for the email field: swap in the `[control]` directive:

```html
<input type="email" [control]="emailAddress" autocomplete="none" />
```

Then we'll update bindings to use signals, and simplify error message rendering:

```html
<div 
    [class.visible]="emailAddress().invalid() && emailAddress().touched()"
    class="error">
    {% raw %}{{ emailAddress().errors()[0]?.message }}{% endraw %}
</div>
```

Finally, the submit button’s `disabled` class will also bind to a signal:

```html
<button [class.disabled]="form().invalid()">Continue</button>
```

To better visualize how the form and model interact, we’ll add the JSON output of our model signal right in the template, super helpful for debugging and understanding signal flow:

```html
<pre>{% raw %}{{ model() | json }}{% endraw %}</pre>
```

## Live Test: Validate, Errors, and Button State

Let’s save and try it out!

Click into the name field and blur, nice! The error message shows up:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-2.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the name field blurred showing the required error message" width="994" height="420" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Let's do the same for the email address:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-3.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the email field blurred showing the required error message" width="998" height="388" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Still works!

The button is disabled while invalid, just like before:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-4.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the submit button disabled because the form is invalid" width="994" height="420" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Now, let's type a valid name:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-7.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the name field entered with a valid name and the error message disappears" width="786" height="824" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

The error disappears, and the model signal updates immediately in sync with what we type.

That’s all thanks to the new signal-based `form()` function.

When we enter an invalid email, we still get the proper message:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-5.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The signup form with the email field entered with a value that's not a valid email address showing the invalid email error message" width="998" height="388" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And once we fix it, everything updates:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-16/demo-8.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The sign-up form updated to Signal Forms with all fields filled out and the form is valid so the submit button is enabled and the values are updated in the model signal" width="794" height="966" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

The button enables, and the UI reacts instantly.

Same behavior, but now fully signal-native.

No more `FormGroup` or `FormControl` ceremony in the class, and our validation messages live right next to the rules that trigger them.

## Wrap-Up: Takeaways, Gotchas, and Next Steps

We just migrated a real-world, user-facing form from Reactive Forms to the new, experimental Signal Forms using:
- A simple data model signal 
- A clean schema with error messages  
- Tight, readable template bindings  

And there’s still so much more we can do, like adding custom validators, stacking multiple errors, or even wiring up form submission as a signal.

This is a huge step forward for Angular’s reactivity story, and it’s exciting to see where it’s headed.
