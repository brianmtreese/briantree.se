<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>f you've ever built a custom control using <a href="https://angular.dev/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor" target="_blank">ControlValueAccessor</a>, you know the drill. It requires several methods, properties, and even providers. Often, it can be a lot just to update a simple value. Well, in Angular 21, that's beginning to change. In this tutorial, we'll migrate a custom quantity control step by step from CVA to signals so you can see just how clean and simple things can become.</p>

## The Quantity Control in Action

Here's the little demo app that we'll be using in this example:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-23/demo-1.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="A very basic quantity selector control" width="696" height="454" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

It's just a basic quantity selector control.

Click the plus button, it goes up. 

Click the minus button, it goes down.

And underneath the control, we're logging out the form value, so as we change the quantity, you can see the number update instantly:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-23/demo-2.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The quantity control with the form value logging out the quantity" width="806" height="426" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Everything works exactly as you'd expect.

So now let's open this up and see how it's all wired together currently.

## How the Reactive Form Is Wired Up

First, let's open up [the template](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-jdarpsv3?file=src%2Fcart%2Fcart.component.html){:target="_blank"} for the cart component.

Here we can see our [quantity-stepper component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-jdarpsv3?file=src%2Fquantity-stepper%2Fquantity-stepper.component.ts){:target="_blank"} with a form control bound to it, straight from Angular's [Reactive Forms module](https://angular.dev/guide/forms/reactive-forms){:target="_blank"}:

```html
<app-quantity-stepper id="qty" [formControl]="quantity" />
```

Binding the control to this component means it's a custom form control that uses `ControlValueAccessor`. 

We'll see more on that in a minute.

Next, we can see that we're outputting the string-interpolated value of the `quantity` form control:

```html
<pre>Form Value: {% raw %}{{ quantity.value }}{% endraw %}</pre>
```

That's the value that updates below as we adjust it:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-23/demo-2.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="The quantity control with the form value logging out the quantity" width="806" height="426" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Now, let's jump to [the TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-jdarpsv3?file=src%2Fcart%2Fcart.component.ts){:target="_blank"} for this component.

We've got a [FormControl](https://angular.dev/api/forms/FormControl){:target="_blank"} named "quantity", initialized with a value of 1, and a min validator that prevents the quantity from ever dropping below 1:

```typescript
protected quantity = new FormControl<number>(1, { 
    nonNullable: true, 
    validators: [Validators.min(1)] 
});
```

Pretty simple setup.

So far, everything here is standard Reactive Forms, but the interesting part is what's inside that stepper component.

## How a ControlValueAccessor Works (Before Signals)

Now this is where things get a little verbose.

Because this is a custom control, we need to make it talk to Angular's form API using the `ControlValueAccessor` interface.

We've got a `providers` array registering [NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR](https://angular.dev/api/forms/NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR){:target="_blank"}:

```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-quantity-stepper',
    ...,
    providers: [{
        provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,
        useExisting: forwardRef(() => QuantityStepperComponent),
        multi: true
    }],
})
```

That's what tells Angular... 

> "Hey, this component knows how to act like a form control."

Then our class implements the interface, which means we have to define several required properties and methods.

We track the value, track the disabled state, implement `onChange` and `onTouched`, handle `writeValue`, `registerOnChange`, `registerOnTouched`, and `setDisabledState`:

```typescript
export class QuantityStepperComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {
    private _value = signal(1);
    value = this._value;
    isDisabled = false;

    private onChange: (v:number)=>void = () => {};

    private onTouched: ()=>void = () => {};

    writeValue(v: number | null): void {
        this._value.set(v ?? 1);
    }

    registerOnChange(fn: (v:number)=>void) { 
        this.onChange = fn; 
    }
    
    registerOnTouched(fn: ()=>void): void { 
        this.onTouched = fn; 
    }
    
    setDisabledState(disabled: boolean): void { 
        this.isDisabled = disabled; 
    }

    ...
}
```

That's already a lot of code before we even get to our own logic.

At the bottom, we've got our custom methods: `increment()` and `decrement()`:

```typescript
protected increment() { 
    this._value.update(v => { 
        const n = v + 1; this.onChange(n); return n;
    });
}

protected decrement() { 
    this._value.update(v => { 
        const n = Math.max(1, v - 1); this.onChange(n); return n; 
    }); 
}
```

Each one updates the internal `_value` signal and calls `onChange` so Angular knows about the new value.

It all works, but it's way too much ceremony for something that just increments a number.

## Template Setup for the Classic CVA Control

Over in [the template](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-jdarpsv3?file=src%2Fquantity-stepper%2Fquantity-stepper.component.html){:target="_blank"}, we're binding a class when the control is disabled:

```html
@let disabled = isDisabled;
<div class="stepper" [class.is-disabled]="disabled">
    ...
</div>
```

Inside that wrapper, we've got a minus button, the displayed value, and a plus button:

```html
<button
    type="button"
    class="btn btn-minus"
    (click)="decrement()"
    [disabled]="disabled"
    aria-label="Decrease quantity">−</button>
<span
    class="qty"
    role="spinbutton"
    [attr.aria-valuenow]="value()"
    aria-valuemin="1"
    tabindex="0">{% raw %}{{ value() }}{% endraw %}</span>
<button
    type="button"
    class="btn btn-plus"
    (click)="increment()"
    [disabled]="disabled"
    aria-label="Increase quantity">+</button>
```

There's no native HTML control like this, so we had to build our own numeric input with custom increment and decrement buttons.

Now that we understand what we're working with, let's modernize it.

## Our Plan to Upgrade to Signal Forms

We're going to migrate this quantity stepper and the form that uses it to [Angular's new experimental Signal Forms API](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/main/packages/forms/signals){:target="_blank"}.

Signal Forms are brand new and only available in Angular 21+ (next builds).

And for the concepts we'll be using in this tutorial, you'll need [Angular 21.0.0-next.8](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases/tag/21.0.0-next.8){:target="_blank"} or later.

**They're experimental,** but the future is coming fast!

Let's see how we can make this control fully signal-driven.

## Refactoring the Custom Control to Signal Forms

Back in the TypeScript, we can remove the entire `providers` array. No more `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR`.

We can also delete the old Reactive Forms imports as well.

Next, we'll replace the `ControlValueAccessor` interface with the new `FormValueControl` interface from the `@angular/forms/signals` package:

```typescript
import { FormValueControl } from '@angular/forms/signals';

export class QuantityStepperComponent implements FormValueControl<number> {
    ...
}
```

Now for the satisfying part we get to delete a *lot* of code.

No more callbacks, no more registration methods, no more `writeValue` or `setDisabledState`.

It all goes!

Then, we'll convert our `value` property into a [model input](https://angular.dev/guide/components/inputs#model-inputs){:target="_blank"} to automatically sync the value between the form and this component, and it's required by the `FormValueControl` interface:

```typescript
import { ..., model } from '@angular/core';

value = model(1);
```

We'll turn our `isDisabled` property into an [input](https://angular.dev/guide/components/inputs){:target="_blank"}:

```typescript
import { ..., input } from '@angular/core';

isDisabled = input(false);
```

We'll simplify `increment()` and `decrement()` methods too. No more `onChange`, just update the signals:

```typescript
protected increment() { 
    this.value.update(v => v + 1);
}

protected decrement() { 
    this.value.update(v => Math.max(1, v - 1));
}
```

Clean, readable, reactive.

## Adapting the Template for Signal Inputs

Now, in the template, we only need one change, the `isDisabled` property should now be called like a signal:

```html
@let disabled = isDisabled();
```

Everything else stays exactly the same. Same UI. Same behavior.

## Rewriting the Cart Component with Signal Forms

Next, let's migrate the form itself.

In the cart component, we can now remove the old `FormControl` and Reactive Forms imports.

We'll create a [signal](https://angular.dev/guide/signals){:target="_blank"} called `model` to hold the form's state object:

```typescript
import { ..., signal } from '@angular/core';

protected model = signal({ quantity: 1 });
```

Then we'll use the new `form()` function from the Signal Forms module to build the form:

```typescript
import { ..., form } from '@angular/forms/signals';

protected cartForm = form();
```

We'll pass our model signal and add validations with the `required()` and `min()` functions also from the Signal Forms module:

```typescript
import { ..., min, required } from '@angular/forms/signals';

protected cartForm = form(this.model, schema => {
    required(schema.quantity);
    min(schema.quantity, 1);
});
```

Now we have a fully reactive form object based on signals with validators applied.

Then we'll import the new `Field` directive which we'll use to replace our old `FormControl` binding:

```typescript
import { ..., Field } from '@angular/forms/signals';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-cart',
    ...,
    imports: [ ..., Field ]
})
```

## Replacing `formControl` with the New `field` Directive

In the template, we'll replace the old binding with the new `field` directive instead:

```html
<app-quantity-stepper id="qty" [field]="cartForm.quantity" />
```

We'll also update the string-interpolated value to reference the new form object:

```html
<pre>Form Value: {% raw %}{{ cartForm.quantity().value() }}{% endraw %}</pre>
```

Last but not least, we'll update the validation message binding too.

```html
@if (cartForm.quantity().invalid()) {
    ...
}
```

That's it, let's test it out:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-23/demo-3.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="The working quantity control with the form value logging out the quantity using the new signal forms module" width="698" height="464" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Nice! Everything still works. Click up, click down, model updates live.

But right now, we can't actually trigger our validation because our decrement logic prevents the value from going below 1.

That's our `min()` validatior working like it should.

But now, we want to test this validator out.

## Validating and Debugging the Signal Form

So, let's remove the guard in the decrement method:

```typescript
protected decrement() {
    this.value.update(v => v - 1);
}
```

Okay, let's save and try it out:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/10-23/demo-4.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="The quantity control validating and showing the error message when the value is below 1" width="696" height="488" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Now, when we click below 1, the validation kicks in.

So this is all pretty slick, right?

Everything works just like before…

✅ But now powered entirely by signals  
✅ No manual callbacks  
✅ No NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR  
✅ No boilerplate

## Why Signal Forms Are the Future of Angular Forms

We went from a `ControlValueAccessor` implementation that required multiple functions, a provider, and a lot of plumbing… to a signal-based control that's just a few lines of code.

Signal Forms are easier to reason about, more declarative, and integrate perfectly with Angular's modern reactive system.
