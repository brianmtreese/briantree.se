<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou ever try to theme an Angular component? Yeah… it sounds easy. Just tweak some colors, maybe adjust a layout, how hard could it be? Well, let me tell you, by the time you're done battling <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host">:host</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host-context">:host-context()</a>, and <a href="ttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties">CSS variables</a>, you'll start questioning everything.</p>

In this stand-up comedy special (that literally no one asked for), Dommy Bytes take you through the hilarious pain of theming in Angular. From random layout breakages to debugging colors that refuse to change, this is the developer therapy session you didn’t know you needed.

## Topics covered (or, “What ruined his week”):

- The absurdity of [:host](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host) and [:host-context()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host-context)
- Why [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) gaslight you into thinking they work
- And how one missing class can send your whole app into chaos
