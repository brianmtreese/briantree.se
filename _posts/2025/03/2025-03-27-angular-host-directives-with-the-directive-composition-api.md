<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n this tutorial, we're going to enhance a simple Angular button component by applying custom directives, and then we‚Äôll combine these directives into the component directly using Angular's <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/directives/directive-composition-api">Directive Composition API</a> feature. Let‚Äôs get started!</p>

## The Starting Point: A Simple Signup Form

Here's the base app we're starting with ‚Äî it's just a simple sign-up form with "name" and "email address" inputs, and a plain old "save" button:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/03-27/demo-1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of a simple signup form in Angular" width="806" height="721" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Nothing fancy yet, but that‚Äôs about to change.

I‚Äôve already created some example directives for this tutorial and what we want to do is apply all of these to this button to enhance the functionality:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/03-27/demo-2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="A screenshot of several Angular directives and a component" width="806" height="472" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

## Controlling Focus with the Auto-Focus Directive for Better UX

The first directive we‚Äôll be adding is the [auto focus directive](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a2x2rcvx?file=src%2Fdirectives%2Fauto-focus.directive.ts):

```typescript
import { Directive, ElementRef, afterNextRender } from "@angular/core";

@Directive({
  selector: "[appAutoFocus]",
})
export class AutoFocusDirective {
  constructor(private elementRef: ElementRef<HTMLElement>) {
    afterNextRender(() => {
      this.elementRef.nativeElement.focus();
    });
  }
}
```

It uses the [afterNextRender](https://angular.dev/api/core/afterNextRender) function to focus the [host element](https://angular.dev/guide/components/host-elements) as soon as it's rendered.

This is handy for forms where you want the user to land right on the first interactive element.

To add this directive, let‚Äôs open up the [root app component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a2x2rcvx?file=src%2Fmain.ts).

Here, we‚Äôve got the form markup in the template:

```html
<form>
  <header>
    <h2>Sign Up</h2>
    <em>Hello! Welcome to the family.</em>
  </header>
  <div>
    <label>
      <strong>Name</strong>
      <input type="text" autocomplete="off" />
    </label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label>
      <strong>Email Address</strong>
      <input type="email" autocomplete="off" />
    </label>
  </div>
  <button appFormButton>Save</button>
</form>
```

There‚Äôs a "name" input, an "email address" input, and our "save" button at the bottom.

This save button is actually using our [form button component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a2x2rcvx?file=src%2Fcomponents%2Fform-button%2Fform-button.component.ts) which we can see with the "appFormButton" attribute selector on the button itself:

```html
<button appFormButton>Save</button>
```

Let‚Äôs enhance the functionality of this button.

To add the directive, let‚Äôs add the "appAutoFocus" attribute right on the button:

```html
<button appFormButton appAutoFocus>Save</button>
```

Then, in order for this to be added to the button properly, we need to add the directive to the imports array of the component:

```typescript
imports: [..., AutoFocusDirective];
```

Ok, now let‚Äôs save and see if this works:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/03-27/demo-3.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of the auto focus directive focusing the save button when the component is initialized" width="900" height="848" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Nice, now the button is focused automatically!

The pink-ish color and the blue-green outline are styles that are applied to the button when it‚Äôs focused.

## Monitoring Hover with the Hover Tracker Directive

Next, we have the [track hover directive](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a2x2rcvx?file=src%2Fdirectives%2Ftrack-hover.directive.ts).

This one listens for [pointerenter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerenter_event) and [pointerleave](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/pointerleave_event) events using the host metadata, and injects a little ‚ÄúHovering!" message when you hover over the element:

```typescript
import {
  Directive,
  ElementRef,
  inject,
  Renderer2,
  signal,
} from "@angular/core";

@Directive({
  selector: "[appTrackHover]",
  host: {
    "(pointerenter)": "this.showHoverMessage()",
    "(pointerleave)": "this.removeHoverMessage()",
  },
})
export class TrackHoverDirective {
  private elementRef = inject(ElementRef<HTMLElement>);
  private renderer = inject(Renderer2);
  private tooltip?: HTMLElement;

  private showHoverMessage() {
    this.tooltip = this.renderer.createElement("span");
    this.renderer.addClass(this.tooltip, "hovering");
    this.tooltip!.textContent = "üëã Hovering!";
    this.renderer.appendChild(this.elementRef.nativeElement, this.tooltip);
  }

  private removeHoverMessage() {
    if (this.tooltip) {
      this.renderer.removeChild(this.elementRef.nativeElement, this.tooltip);
      this.tooltip = undefined;
    }
  }
}
```

It uses [Renderer2](https://angular.dev/api/core/Renderer2) to create and clean up the tooltip element.

Now, a directive like this would probably be used for something like stats or analytics in the real world, but for this demo, it just shows a simple message.

Like the last example, this is really easy to add to our button, we just add the selector right on the button element:

```html
<button appFormButton appAutoFocus appTrackHover>Save</button>
```

Then we need to import it in the component imports array:

```typescript
imports: [..., TrackHoverDirective];
```

Ok, now we can save:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/03-27/demo-4.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of the hover tracking directive showing a message when the button is hovered over" width="806" height="760" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And when we hover over the button, boom ‚Äî there‚Äôs our ‚ÄúHovering‚Äù message.

It‚Äôs injected directly into the DOM by the directive and disappears when we move the mouse away.

## Disabling the Button While Loading with the Disable on Loading Directive

The last directive we‚Äôre going to add is the [disable on loading directive](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a2x2rcvx?file=src%2Fdirectives%2Fdisable-on-loading.directive.ts):

```typescript
import { Directive, input } from "@angular/core";

@Directive({
  selector: "[appDisableOnLoading]",
  host: {
    "[disabled]": "this.loading()",
  },
})
export class DisableOnLoadingDirective {
  loading = input<boolean>(false);
}
```

This one uses an [input()](https://angular.dev/api/core/input) signal to determine whether the host element should be disabled.

The actual disabling is done declaratively from the parent and then the [disabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/disabled) attribute is bound on the host element in the host metadata based on the value of the input.

Let‚Äôs wire it up on our button.

First, like the others, we need to add the directive selector to the button:

```html
<button appFormButton appAutoFocus appTrackHover appDisableOnLoading>
  Save
</button>
```

And we need to import it too:

```typescript
imports: [..., DisableOnLoadingDirective];
```

But this one is a little more complicated.

We need to pass the loading state to the input for the directive, but we don‚Äôt have anything for this just yet.

Let‚Äôs start by adding an ‚ÄúisSaving‚Äù [signal](https://angular.dev/api/core/signal) with an initial value of false.

```typescript
protected isSaving = signal(false);
```

This will track whether we‚Äôre currently saving the form or not.

We‚Äôll also create another [signal](https://angular.dev/api/core/signal) called ‚ÄúsaveStatus‚Äù, which will hold a success message once the save is complete.

```typescript
protected saveStatus = signal("");
```

Now, we need to add a function to set these signals that will be called when the button is clicked.

Let‚Äôs call it `handleClick()`.

When the button is clicked, we‚Äôll set ‚ÄúisSaving‚Äù to true, then simulate a delay using `setTimeout`.

After 4 seconds, we‚Äôll mark ‚ÄúisSaving‚Äù as false and update the status message:

```typescript
protected handleClick() {
  this.isSaving.set(true);
  setTimeout(() => {
    this.isSaving.set(false);
    this.saveStatus.set('Data saved successfully!');
  }, 4000);
}
```

Now let‚Äôs actually bind the `isSaving()` signal to the ‚Äúloading‚Äù input for our `appDisableOnLoading` directive:

```html
<button ... appDisableOnLoading [loading]="isSaving()">Save</button>
```

Then, we‚Äôll use click event binding to call our `handleClick()` function when the button is clicked:

```html
<button ... appDisableOnLoading [loading]="isSaving()" (click)="handleClick()">
  Save
</button>
```

Lastly, we want to show our success message when the ‚ÄúsaveStatus‚Äù exists after the simulated save completes:

```html
@if (saveStatus()) {
<p>‚úÖ {% raw %}{{ saveStatus() }}{% endraw %}</p>
}
```

Ok, that should be everything we need, let‚Äôs save and try it out:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/03-27/demo-5.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of the disable on loading directive disabling the button when the button is clicked" width="802" height="782" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Now, when you click the button, it becomes disabled, that‚Äôs our directive in action,
and after 4 seconds, the message appears confirming the data was saved.

So, this is all cool, right?

We‚Äôve added a lot of functionality to this button now with these directives.

But what if we want this functionality to be included with this button component every time we add it?

Well, we could add the code from each of the directives to the code for the component, but that‚Äôs not a great idea because we may want to use these directives outside of this component too.

So, what else can we do?

## Composing Directives with hostDirectives and the Directive Composition API

Well, we can actually add these directives to the [form button component](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a2x2rcvx?file=src%2Fform-button%2Fform-button.component.ts) with the `hostDirectives` property.

In this array, we can add whatever directives we want to the host of this component, so let‚Äôs add the auto focus directive first.

```typescript
hostDirectives: [
  { directive: AutoFocusDirective }
],
```

Now, we can remove it from the root component too.

And that‚Äôs it, let‚Äôs save and make sure it still works:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/03-27/demo-3.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example adding the auto focus directive to the button using the Directive Composition API" width="900" height="848" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Nice, the button still gets focused when it‚Äôs initialized, but now our root component is simpler, no need to apply the directive manually.

So, let‚Äôs go ahead and add the [track hover directive](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a2x2rcvx?file=src%2Fdirectives%2Ftrack-hover.directive.ts) now:

```typescript
hostDirectives: [
  ...,
  { directive: TrackHoverDirective }
],
```

Then, we need to remove it from the root app component too.

Ok, now let‚Äôs save again and make sure it still works properly:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/03-27/demo-4.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example adding the hover tracking directive to the button using the Directive Composition API" width="806" height="760" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

Nice, it looks like we still get the ‚ÄúHovering‚Äù message when we hover over the button.

All without repeating logic in the main app component.

### Passing Inputs with the Directive Composition API

Finally, let‚Äôs add the [disable on loading directive](https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-a2x2rcvx?file=src%2Fdirectives%2Fdisable-on-loading.directive.ts) to the component too:

```typescript
hostDirectives: [
  ...,
  { directive: DisableOnLoadingDirective }
],
```

But this one is a little different because it has an input, right?

Well, to do this, we can add the inputs array where we can simply pass our ‚Äúloading‚Äù input to the directive:

```typescript
hostDirectives: [
  ...,
  {
    directive: DisableOnLoadingDirective,
    inputs: ["loading"]
  }
],
```

Then, we can remove this directive from the root app component too, but we will need to keep the "loading" input and the `handleClick()` function too:

```html
<button appFormButton [loading]="isSaving()" (click)="handleClick()">
  Save
</button>
```

Now, when we save, everything should work the same:

<div>
<img src="{{ '/assets/img/content/uploads/2025/03-27/demo-5.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Example adding all three directives to the button using the Directive Composition API" width="802" height="782" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

And it looks like it does, nice!

The button disables during saving, shows the hover message, and gets autofocus.

But now all of that is encapsulated in one clean, reusable component.

We don‚Äôt need to add all of these directives to the button each time we use it.

## Conclusion: Clean, Reusable, and Powerful

And that‚Äôs it!

We took three Angular directives and composed them into a form button using hostDirectives and the [Directive Composition API](https://angular.dev/guide/directives/directive-composition-api).

This keeps our app clean and makes the button logic reusable across the entire app.
