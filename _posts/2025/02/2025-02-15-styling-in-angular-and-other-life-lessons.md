<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ver tried styling a component in Angular? Itâ€™s not just CSSâ€”itâ€™s an event! From class binding to <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/components/styling#ng-deep">::ng-deep</a>, from <a href="https://angular.dev/guide/components/styling#style-scoping">ViewEncapsulation</a> to the mystical powers of !important, this is the wild world of Angular styling!</p>

In this hilarious stand-up comedy session, Dommy Bytes takes a developerâ€™s perspective on why styling in Angular feels like a fashion show for your components, why [class binding](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/binding#css-class-and-style-property-bindings) is basically a game show, and how CSS specificity makes us all question reality.

## Expect Jokes About:

- The endless ways to style in Angular ([SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), inline styles, [class bindings](https://angular.dev/guide/templates/binding#css-class-and-style-property-bindings)â€¦ etc.)
- [ViewEncapsulation](https://angular.dev/guide/components/styling#view-encapsulation): Angularâ€™s way of putting styles in a VIP section
- [::ng-deep](https://angular.dev/guide/components/styling#ng-deep), because sometimes you just need to break in!
- Why we all secretly blame the cache when styles donâ€™t update
- The true power of [!important](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/important) (aka, CSS duct tape)

If youâ€™re an Angular developer, front-end dev, or just someone whoâ€™s fought with CSS, this oneâ€™s for you!
