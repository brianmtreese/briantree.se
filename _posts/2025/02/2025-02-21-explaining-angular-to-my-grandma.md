<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>rying to explain Angular to my grandma was a mistake... but here we are ðŸ˜‚. In this stand-up comedy bit, Dommy Bytes breaks down the difference between <a href="https://angular.dev/api/core/viewChild">viewChild()</a> and <a href="https://angular.dev/api/core/contentChild">contentChild()</a>, Angular's "view" vs. "content", and why debugging Angular sometimes feels like talking to a passive-aggressive roommate.</p>
