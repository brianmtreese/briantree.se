<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>rying to explain Angular to my grandma was a mistake... but here we are 😂. In this stand-up comedy bit, Dommy Bytes breaks down the difference between <a href="https://angular.dev/api/core/viewChild">viewChild()</a> and <a href="https://angular.dev/api/core/contentChild">contentChild()</a>, Angular's "view" vs. "content", and why debugging Angular sometimes feels like talking to a passive-aggressive roommate.</p>

## Topics Covered:
* What is [viewChild()](https://angular.dev/api/core/viewChild) vs [contentChild()](https://angular.dev/api/core/contentChild)?
* Why does Angular pretend not to see your projected content?
* Debugging Angular… or why your app silently judges you
* The real reason we all stick with Angular (Hint: Laziness)
