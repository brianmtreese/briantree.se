In this stand-up comedy session, Dommy Bytes shares his hilarious struggle with [Angular Animations](https://angular.dev/guide/animations). How a simple fade-in turned into a full cinematic experience, why his buttons now have trust issues, and how he accidentally gave his 404 page a dramatic exit.

## ðŸ”¥ What You'll Laugh About in This Video:
* Why every developer underestimates animations... until it's too late
* The moment a submit button literally flew off the screen
* How he spent hours tweaking timing functions like he works for NASA
* Why he now animates everything (even his error pages have emotions)

If you've ever wrestled with @angular/animations, timing functions, or just over-engineered something way beyond what was necessary, this one's for you! ðŸ˜†
